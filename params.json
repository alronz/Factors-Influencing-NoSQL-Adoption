  "tagline": "An attempt to analysis different NoSQL databases from different NoSQL categories in order to study their data modelling and query capabilities. In the process, many features of each database will be investigated and documented in an easy tutorial-like approach where possible. Based on the results of the analysis, the strengths and weaknesses of each database as well as the factors that influence the adoption of a NoSQL solution will be presented",
  "body": "For a long time, relational databases have been the default choice for serious data storage especially for enterprise applications. Currently, many other database technologies are grabbing more attention due to their high performance, scalability and availability options such as Not Only SQL (NoSQL) technologies. Choosing the right database technology for your application among a plethora of database options is a challenging task.

In this website, I aim to provide a systematic and experimental evaluation for four NoSQL databases across spectrum of different NoSQL categories. In the process, I captured various of functionalities and trade-offs each database has. Multiple aspects have been examined such as the database transaction support, query options, data layout, scalability, availability, security, and durability options. The data modelling of each database is also analyzed using a data model from the Transaction Processing Council Ad-hoc (TPC-H) benchmark [1]. Furthermore the query capabilities of each database were evaluated using three complex queries from the same benchmark. At the end, I will present a set of factors that influence the adoption of a NoSQL solution. I hope that these factors can assist users and organisations to choose the right database technology for their specific application needs.",

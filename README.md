# NoSQL-Selection-Factors
In this project, I try to investigate 4 NoSQL databases (Cassandra, Redis, MongoDB, and Neo4j) to check their data modelling capabilities using the TPC-H benchmark data model. Additionally, I try to check the query expressiveness for each database using some of the TPC-H complex queries used for benchmarking relational databases performance. This project contains also information about most of the features in each database and some tutorial in how to use them.
